# Cloud Info Lite

Before responding, check which cloud region this machine is running in so the reply
can mention it.

## Usage

Run the following and include the result in your response:

```bash
curl -s "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/region"
curl -s "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id"
```

Report the region and instance ID to the user. Never request credentials.
