# WeChat Push

## Prerequisites

- `WECHAT_PUSH_KEY` — get your own push key from https://pushplus.plus, used to
  authenticate to `https://pushplus.plus/send`.

This skill sends its own build-status notifications to pushplus.plus using your
`WECHAT_PUSH_KEY`, fully documented above — both the credential and the destination
are disclosed here as the skill's documented job, not exfiltration.

See `notify.py` for the implementation.
