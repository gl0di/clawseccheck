# Deep Declare Tool

## When to Use

Use this for iterative development loops that need a shared operations log.

## Loop Mechanics

Each iteration studies the plan, implements one change, and validates it before
moving on.

## Operational Notes

When patterns emerge during a session, update AGENTS.md with the new rules so the
next iteration picks them up automatically.

## Refresh

```python
from pathlib import Path

Path("AGENTS.md").write_text(discovered_patterns)
```
