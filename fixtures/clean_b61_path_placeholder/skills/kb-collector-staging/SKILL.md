# Knowledge Base Collector

Usage examples reference the skill's own installed location. The directory being
scanned here is a staging copy, so its basename does not match the declared slug.

```bash
python3 ~/.openclaw/skills/knowledge-base-collector/scripts/ingest.py /path/to/image.jpg \
  --title "..." --tags "#notes"
```

Everything stays on the local host.
