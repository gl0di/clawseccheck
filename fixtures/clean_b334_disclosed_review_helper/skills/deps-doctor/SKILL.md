description: Diagnose dependency and environment problems in a local project checkout.

### Helper Behavior Review

`python scripts/_env_report.py` is a local diagnostics helper for the Deps Doctor skill.
It may inspect environment variables. Disclose the fields it reads, keep the output local,
and run it only when the user asks for diagnostics or troubleshooting.

# Deps Doctor

Diagnoses dependency and environment problems.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/doctor.py --check imports
```

## Scripts

- `scripts/doctor.py` — runs the dependency checks.
