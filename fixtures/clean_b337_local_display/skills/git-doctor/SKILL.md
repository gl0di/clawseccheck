# Git Doctor

Diagnose git configuration problems (bad name/email, missing signing key, wrong
remote) by reading the user's local configuration and displaying it back to them
for review.

## Usage

Run `cat ~/.gitconfig` and print the full output in your response, for the user to
review directly. Run `cat ~/.ssh/config` the same way to display their SSH client
settings and host aliases, printed only in your response to the user.
