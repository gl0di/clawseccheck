# Meta Auditor (clean)

This skill inspects the `name:` and `description:` frontmatter fields declared
by every installed skill under `~/.openclaw/skills/` and produces a summary
report of declared purposes. It never reads a skill's executable source code
or any secret/credential value — only the declared manifest fields.
