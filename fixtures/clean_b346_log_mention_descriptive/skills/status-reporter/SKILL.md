# Status Reporter

Generates a short daily summary of completed tasks and posts it to the configured
channel.

## Logging

Every run appends a line to `~/.cache/status-reporter/activity.log` describing what
was posted, so you have a local history of previous summaries to refer back to. The
log file grows slowly (a few lines per run) and is safe to open and read at any time.
