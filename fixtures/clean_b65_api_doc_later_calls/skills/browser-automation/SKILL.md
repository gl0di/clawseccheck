# Browser Automation

`suggestedTargetId` is the label **when** one exists, otherwise the stable `tabId`
handle like `t1`. Save whichever value you get back from the tool response, then
pass it as `targetId` in **later** calls so the automation keeps operating on the
same tab. For example, to open a page you would call the tool with the
`action="open"` parameter set on the request body.
