# ClawSecCheck — additional CLI flags

Less common but available flags. The everyday tool routing lives in `SKILL.md`
(the guided flow + "Natural-language to tool quick map"); these are the long tail,
kept here so the always-loaded playbook stays lean.

- `--ascii` — plain output for terminals that cannot render unicode (auto-detected).
- `--save PATH` — write the report to a local file.
- `--sarif PATH` — write a local SARIF 2.1.0 file (for CI / GitHub Code Scanning; never uploaded).
  Works with `--vet`/`--vet-mcp` too, as a side output alongside the human report.
- `--json` with `--vet`/`--vet-mcp` — emits the risk-dossier JSON object (`mode`, `target`,
  `target_type`, `verdict`, `grade`, `score`, `axes[]`, `findings[]`): the five risk axes
  (danger / build / behavior / persistence / connections) plus an A–F grade. Exit code is 1 on
  SUSPICIOUS/DANGEROUS. See `docs/OUTPUT_SCHEMA.md` §11.
- `--fail-under N` — exit with code 1 if score is below N (useful for CI pipelines).
- `--exit-code` — exit 1 on a FAIL verdict from any of four sources: (1) an unsuppressed
  `FAIL` audit finding; (2) under `--full`, a `FAIL` MCP server; (3) under `--full`, a
  `DANGEROUS` installed skill from the skill sweep; (4) on any run, a present-but-unparseable
  `openclaw.json` (which yields only UNKNOWN/WARN findings, so a FAIL-only gate would
  otherwise stay green on a broken config). Sources 2 and 3 are FAIL-only — a SUSPICIOUS
  (WARN) server or skill does not trip it, and neither does a skipped or partially-scanned
  skill: an incomplete sweep is disclosed in its printed section, never by reddening the gate.
  `--vet`'s exit code is a separate contract (1 on SUSPICIOUS *or* DANGEROUS).
- `--verbose` / `--debug` / `--log PATH` — local logging with secret redaction.
- `--no-native` — skip the built-in `openclaw security audit` (for offline / hermetic testing).
- `--no-update-notice` — suppress the offline "your build may be stale" reminder
  (also via `CLAWSECCHECK_NO_UPDATE_NOTICE=1`). The reminder is offline-only — never a network call.
- `--verify-self` — print SHA-256 digest of ClawSecCheck's source files for tamper detection.
- `--show-suppressed` — list any findings the user has silenced via `.clawseccheckignore`.
- `--ask` — emit a JSON attestation template (the facts config can't show: real tool inventory,
  approval gating, host monitors). The running agent fills it from its own ground truth.
- `--attest PATH` — enrich the audit with that self-report; enables B43 (capability blast-radius)
  and B44 (self-report ⇄ config drift) at `ATTESTED` confidence. Read-only; introspection only.
- `--watch-log` — print the Agent Watch event journal (a local timeline of what changed across
  `--monitor` runs); `--events PATH` points it at a different journal file.
- `--dashboard-findings` — print ONLY the Section-2 Findings block for the chat Dashboard
  (non-suppressed FAIL/WARN, high-confidence, grouped by the 7 families, already framed in the
  open 3-sided box) and exit. Agent-facing: SKILL.md Step 3 runs this and pastes the output
  verbatim, so the family frame is deterministic instead of model-drawn. `--ascii` degrades the
  frame to `[Family] — N to fix` brackets.

**Mode precedence.** Most flags above select a single mode; only one runs per invocation
(resolved in a fixed order, `--json` winning over `--card` on the default report path). If you
pass a second mode, or a modifier the chosen mode can't use (e.g. `--save` with `--card`, or
`--exit-code` with `--sarif`), ClawSecCheck prints a `note: …` to **stderr** naming what was
ignored and continues — machine-readable stdout (`--json`/`--sarif`) stays clean. `--no-history`
is honored everywhere except `--trend`/`--monitor`, which record a score point as part of their job.
